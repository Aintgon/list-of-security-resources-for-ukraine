## Additional Resources

### Chris Culling ([@chrisculling](https://twitter.com/chrisculling))

is also compiling a spreadsheet titled Free Cyber & Humanitarian Services for Ukraine, which has some additional content for businesses needing cybersecurity services, but **also** has content for individuals needing many essential security/communications resources (free texts/calls/connectivity, VPN accounts for journalists, antimalware, etc.).

As his list is exceptionally high quality and extends the services/options available to those in need, we are linking to it instead of duplicating his excellent work: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WYY9p1_DLwB6dnXoiiOAoWYD8X0voXtoDl_ZQzjzUQ/

## Notes

To make this most effective, this repository will **only** take entities which are making tangible commitments to Ukraine or other countries in need. **No** thoughts & prayers are allowed on this list. Further, entities that provide easy to access services will be placed near the top of their section, and those making a specific commitment to provide services to Ukraine but not detailing how Ukrainians could access those services will be placed near the bottom of their section.
